1、ONTAP Integrated Data Protection:
	SLA:
		service-level agreement
		RPO:
			Recovery point objective
			the maximun acceptable a mount of data that can be lost if a failure occurs.
		RTO:
			Recovery time objective
			the maximum acceptable amount of time that can pass before data is made avaliable after a failure.
	NDMP:
		Network Data Management protocol
	SnapLock:
		"write once,read many"(WORM) solution that meets external and internal requirements for retaining,protecting and providing access to regulated and reference data
	SnapVault:
		Replication-based disk-to-disk backup
	SnapMirror:
		Protect all or some of the volumes in an SVM
		Asynchronous volume-level data replication for data movement and disaster recovery
	SyncMirror:
		Synchronous aggregate-level mirroring for MetroCluster configuration,ONTAP Select and ONTAP Cloud high availability 
	FlexClone:
		Instantaneous space-efficient copies of replicated data
	Load-Sharing Mirror:
		Namespaces (SVM root volume) protection
	NetApp Storage Encryption:
		Full-disk encryption using self-encrypting disks
	NetApp Volume Encryption:
		Software-base data at-rest encryption 

2、Concepts:
	FlexVol volume types:
		Read/Write(-type rw)
			Is the default volume type
			Stores user data
			Contains files or LUNs
		Data protection(-type dp)
			Is at the destination of a mirror or vault relationship
			Stors a copy of the contents of the source volume
			Is read-only
	Data protection:
		for data protection mirror copies
	Extended data protection(XDP):
		for SnapVault relationships
		for version-flexible SnapMirror relationship
	Load-sharing(LS):
		for SVM root-volume protection
