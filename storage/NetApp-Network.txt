Network:
 	1、Management Networks:
 		
	2、Data Networks:
			a、Ethernet network:
				Ethernet ports
				Support for NFS,CIFS,and iSCSI protocols
			b、FC network:
				FC ports
				Support for FC protocol
			c、Converged Network:
				Unified Target Adapter(UTA) ports
				Support for NFS,CIFS,iSCSI and FCoE protocols
	3、Logical Interface(LIF):
		Represents the IP address or a worldwide port name(WWPN) that is asscociated with a networl port.
		LSFs are associated with a particular SVM.
		Cluster administrators can create ,view,modify,migrate or delete LIFs.
		SVM administrators can view only the LIFs that are associated with the SVM.
		Properties:
			Associated SVM
			Role:

				c、Data:
					An interface for communication with clients or hosts
					Scoped to a specific SVM(any node)
				d、Intercluster:
					An interface for cross-cluster communication,backup,and replication 
					Scoped to a specific node
				e、Node Management:
					An dedicated interface for managing a particular node
					Scoped to a specific node
