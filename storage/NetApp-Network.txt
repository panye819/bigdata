		Data aggragate:
			Default of RAID_DP witrh five-disk minimun for most disk type
			Container for SAS,SATA,SSD,or array LUNs.
	Advanced Disk Partitioning(ADP)
		shared disks for more efficient resourse use
		Lower disk consumption requirements
	Hybrid Aggregates:
		Flash Pool aggregate
		SAS or SATA disks for user data
		SSDs for high-performance caching
		User case:
			OLTP
	RAID_DP(Dual-Parity)
		rovides two parity disks to protect the data in the event of a double-disk failure.
		require a minimum of 5 disks.
	RAID_TEC:
		provides three parity disks to protect the data in the event of a triple-disk failure.
		require a minimum of 7 disks.
	Replicated Database(RDB):
		Basis of clustering
		An instance on each node in the cluster
		In user by several processes
		The RDB stores data for the management ,volume location,logical interface,SAN,and configuration replication services.
