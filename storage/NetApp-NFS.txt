2、Concepts:
	NIS：
		Network Information System
	DNS:
		Domain Information System
	LDAP:
		Lightweight Directory Access Protocol:
3、Type of NFS:
	Basic NFS
	NFS with NIS
	NFS with DNS and LDAP
	NFS with PC-NFS
	NFS with WebNFS
4、kerberos:
	Features of kerberos V5:
		provides better security than AUTH_SYS does
		Uses Kerberos credentials to access the file system
		Does not handle authorization
	The three Kerberos modes:
		sec=krb5:
			Authenticates each NFS request and response
		sec=krb5i:
			works the same way as krb5 ,but adds integrity checking to veryify that request and response have not been tampered with
		sec=krb5p:
			works the same way sa krb5i ,but adds data encryption to each request and response.
5、Data ONTAP Hardening Access Mechanisms:
	wafl.root_only_chown:
		enforces the restriction that only the root may change the ownership of files.
	nosuid export option:
		Allows you to restrict the privilege of changing directory and file ownership to the root user.
		Disables setuid and setgid executables and mknod commands
		Is not supported in NFSv4
6、Performance:
	Factors affecting NFS Peformance:
		CPU
		Memory
		System bus
		Network and network interface cards
		Nonvolatile random access memory(NVRAM)
		I/O devices(disk controllers and disks)
	Displaying Qtree Access Statistics:
		qtree stats
		qtress stats [-z] [vol_name]
		the qtree stats counters are reset when:
			The system is booted
			The volume containing the qtree is brought online
			The counters are explicitly reset using the qtree stats -z command.
	Data ONTAP Tools for Collecting Performance Data:
		Data ONTAP tools:
			sysstat
			netstat
			ifstat
			stats
			statit:
				statit -b : start data collection 
			netdiag:
				analyzes network protocol code statistics
