1、SAN vs NAS:
	Storage Area Network
	Block-level Access
	A storage system with both NAS and SAN storage is a unified storage system.

2、Concepts:
	LUN：
		Logical Unit Number
		is a logical representation of a physical SCSI disk.
		Logical Block:512 Bytes
		Logical blocks are not the same as WAFL 4-kB physical blocks.
	Protocols:
		FC
		iSCSI
		FCoE
		SCSI:
			SCSI provides low-level block access to data
			Low-level block access is highly efficient and requires less overhead than NAS requires.
			SCSI can provide a high level of resiliency.
			The relationship between an initiator and a target is called a nexus.
	SVM with FlexVol Volumes
		Each SVM represents a unique SCSI target.
		Volumes are container for LUNs in a SAN environment.
			Never create LUNs in the SVM root volume.
		SAN data logical interface(LIFs):
			FC LIF addressing is assigned autimatically
			iSCSI LIF addressing can be assigned manually or automatically
			Do not fail over
			Restrictions on migration
	Unified Target Adapter(UTA):
		iSCSI,FCoE
		UTA2 ports:
			FC or iSCSI and FCoE
	IMT:
		Interoperability Matrix Tool


3、Zoning:
	Reduces or eliminates crosstalk between initiator HBAs
	Reduces the number of available paths between a host and a specific LUN
	Increases security
	Improves SAN reliability and reduces the amount of time that is required to resolve problems
	
4、Multipath:
	Multipath I/O uses redundant physical path components to create logical paths between the host and the storage system.
	Asymmetrical Logical Unit Access(ALUA):
		identifies a group of target prots that provide a common failover behavior for a LUN.
		States:
			Active and Optimized
			Active and Non-optimized
			Standby
			Unavailable
	Selection Policy
		A multipath I/O driver uses a selection policy to choose one or more paths
		For example ,a windows administrator can apply these policies:
			Failover Only
			Round Robin,Round Robin with subnet
			Least Queue Depth
			Weighted Paths
			Least Blocks
