SVM:
 	1、Data SVM:
 		Stored in data SVM:
 			a、Data volumes that serve client data
 			b、Logical interface(LIFS) that serve client data
 		Data SVM volume types:
 			a、FlexVol volumes
 			b、FlexGroup volumes
 			c、Infinite volumes

	2、Benefits:
			a、Secure multitenancy:
				Partitioning of a storage system
				Isolation of data and management
				No data flow among SVMs in cluster
			b、Nondisruptive opetations and upgrades:
				Resource migration
				Resource avaliability during hardware and software upgrades
			c、Scalability:
				Adding and removing SVMs as needed
				Modifying SVMs for data throughput and storage requirements on demand
			d、Unifed Storage:
				SVMs with FlexVol volumes
					NAS protocols: 
						CIFS and NFS
					SAN protocols :
						iSCSI and FC (FCoE included)
			e、Delegation of management:
				User authentication and administrator authentication
				Access assigned by the cluster administrator
	3、Data LIFs:
		a、NAS data LIFs:
				Multiprotocol(NFS,CIFS or both)
				Manually or automatically assigned IP address
				Failover or migration to any node in the cluster
		b、SAN data LIFs:
				Single-protocol(FC or iSCSI):
					FC LIF is assigned a WWPN when created.
					iSCSI LIF IP addresses can be manually or automatically assigned
				No failover
				Restrictions on migration
