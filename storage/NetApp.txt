Aggregates:
	composed RAID groups that contain disks or array LUNs;
		All RAID must be the same RAID type
		Aggregates contain the same disk type
	have a single copy of data called plex:
		a plex contains all the raid groups that belong to the aggragate
		mirrored aggregates hava two plex.
		a pool of hot spare disks is assigned to each plex.	
	Type:
		Root aggregate (aggr 0):
			1、creation is automatic during system initialization
			2、Container is only for the node's root volume with log files and configuration information.
			3、ONTAP prevents you from creating other volumes in the root aggragate.
		Data aggragate:
			Default of RAID_DP witrh five-disk minimun for most disk type
			Container for SAS,SATA,SSD,or array LUNs.
	Advanced Disk Partitioning(ADP)
		shared disks for more efficient resourse use
		Lower disk consumption requirements
	Hybrid Aggregates:
		Flash Pool aggregate
		SAS or SATA disks for user data
		SSDs for high-performance caching
		User case:
			OLTP
	RAID_DP(Dual-Parity)
		rovides two parity disks to protect the data in the event of a double-disk failure.
		require a minimum of 5 disks.
	RAID_TEC:
		provides three parity disks to protect the data in the event of a triple-disk failure.
		require a minimum of 7 disks.
	Replicated Database(RDB):
		Basis of clustering
		An instance on each node in the cluster
		In user by several processes
		The RDB stores data for the management ,volume location,logical interface,SAN,and configuration replication services.

Type of Volumes:
	FlexVol:

	FlexClone:

	Traditional:

	Cache:

	Root Volume:
		sysfiles，logfiles，
	Infinite Volume:
		up to 2 billion files
		up to 10 PB 
		data constituents role
		namespace consitituent track file
		namespace mirror consitituent is a data protection mirror copy of the namespace consitituent.
WAFL:
	Write Anywhere File Layout 
	organizes blocks of data on disk into files
	FlexVol volumes represent the file system
	Consistency Point:
		Certain circumstances trigger a CP:
			1、A ten-second timer runs out
			2、An NVRAM buffer fills up and it is time to flush the writes to disk
			3、A snapshot copy is created.
